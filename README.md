CsSq-1 is a 4 Voice synthesier and programmable step sequencer.

To run Webpack in production mode, run 'npm run build', wait for build, and then run 'npm start' to open app on localhost:3000.

To run Webpack is development mode, run 'npm run dev' to open app on localhost:8080 (with server proxy running on localhost:3000).

In order to use user preset storage features, you must be running a local instance of MongoDB.

Thank you and enjoy :)
