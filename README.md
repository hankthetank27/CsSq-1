To run Webpack in production mode, run 'npm run build', wait for build, and run 'npm start' to open app on localhost:3000.

To run Webpack is development mode, run 'npm run dev' to open app on localhost:8080 (with server proxy running on localhost:3000).

In order to access user login, register, and preset storage features, you must be running a local instance of MongoDB.

In Ubuntu: 

'sudo service mongodb start'

'mongo'

Thank you and enjoy :)
