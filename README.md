CsSq-1 is a 4 voice synthesizer and programmable step sequencer, built with React and Tone.JS. Includes support for user preset storage via an Express/Node server and a NoSQL, MongoDB database.  

For the latest build run `npm run build` followed by `npm start`, and open app on http://localhost:3000.

To run in development mode, run `npm run dev` and open app on http://localhost:8080.

In order to access user login, register, and preset storage features, you must be running a local instance of MongoDB.

Thank you and enjoy :)
